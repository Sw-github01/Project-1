# Analysis of Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey
A collection of iPython Notebooks on GitHub because in order to do a decent revision control on ipython notebooks you need to save them after clearing all data. Most of these are just scratch notebooks I've created to describe something to other people or to learn how something works.

#Installation Pre-requisite Mini Conda Installation with python 3
Details of installation can be found https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

#Project Motivation
The project is to excercise Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey and draw insights of questions as:
What are the factor contribute to the Career satisfaction, and how accurate we could predicate Career satisfaction basedo n the features selected?
What are the factor contribute to the Stack Overflow satisfaction, and how accurate we could predicate Career satisfaction basedo n the features selected?
What's the relationshipe between Formal education and Career satisfaction, are they postive correlated?

#File Descriptions
